## Organization ##

The directory tree will follow a **year**/**round**/**problem** structure.

Every problem

- Will be in a directory named using the point value and the problem name, like **30 Balanced smileys**.
- Will have a readme file with the full description of the problem.
- Will contain an `example` directory with the input and output files provided in the problem description.
- The input provided for the submision will be saved in the `data` directory.
- The output generated by the soulution will be saved in the `generated` directory.

## The tight loop ##

I'm using the simplest quickest feedback loop I could come up with:

1. Run the program piping in the solution from the example file, and piping out the output to an output file.
1. Diff the output file against the expected output file.
1. Repeat

`test.sh` does the first two steps. The  `watch` utility does the repeating part. You can use this to program in any language and name the program as you wish.

An example using php: 

    watch -n 1 "./test.sh ~/hacker-cup/00/15 'php solve.php'"

Using python:

    watch -n 1 "./test.sh ~/hacker-cup/00/15 'python solve.py'"
